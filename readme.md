# MoneyMod

This is a basic Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 mod that creates some money items for use with a currency system.

On the server I'm writing this for, we're going to use OpenComputers to create a bank that stores currency and allows it to be used for trade.

If you want to see your language supported, please make an issue with the translations, or even better, a pull request.

To do this, copy the `en_US.lang` file and change everything to the right of the equal signs to the new translation.

All my code is MIT. Beyond that, check out the /dist folder for more stuff from the upstream developers for the FML.

All of the icons in the mod were created by my friend Eonaut, and are CC0.

Those can be found in `/src/resources/assets/moneymod/textures/items`

The de_DE translation was created by another friend DennisQt.
